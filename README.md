dotfiles
========
Like Jarrod, if I could be like Jarrod. I hear it all the time. Well it's your
lucky day. This repository contains (as the name implies) my dotfiles. This
should be cloned to your home directory as `~/dotfiles/`. 

Q: "But Jarrod is getting this set up difficult?"

A: Don't worry yourself! Jarrod is going to take care of you. Included 
is a make_sym_links script that will again as the name implies create symlinks
in your home folder to all of the files and folders contained in the repo.
That's all there is to it. Follow the instructions below and you will be set.

Installation
------------
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/JarrodCTaylor/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles 
bash make_sym_links
```
