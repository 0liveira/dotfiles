# dotfiles

In my opinion *which I respect very much* what you have stumbled across right here is the best dotfiles money can buy. I have and continue to spend a ridiculous amount of time grooming and enhancing this treasure trove of developer tools. So if you love the command line, and I know you do, then do yourself a favor, grab a copy and get to coding.

## Installation

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/JarrodCTaylor/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles 
bash set_up_linux.sh
# or
bash set_up_osx.sh
```

# Contents 

## Zsh
## Vim
## Tmux
