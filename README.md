dotfiles
========
Like Jarrod, if I could be like Jarrod. I hear it all the time. Well it's your
lucky day. This repository contains (as the name implies) my dotfiles. This
should be cloned to your home directory as `~/dotfiles/`. 

Q: "But Jarrod is getting this set up difficult?"

A: Don't worry yourself! Jarrod is going to take care of you. Included 
is a config_linux_environment script that will again as the name implies 
take care of all the configuration for you. It will create symlinks in your 
home folder to all of the files and folders contained in the repo.  And 
optionally install all of the packages that I commonly use. That's all 
there is to it. Follow the instructions below and you will be set.

Installation
------------
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/JarrodCTaylor/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles 
bash config_linux_environment.sh
```
